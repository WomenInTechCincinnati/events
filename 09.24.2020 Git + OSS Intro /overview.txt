Title: git commit (to memory): intro to open source and Github

Join us for a crash course on git and contributing to Open Source 
in preparation for Hacktoberfest!

New to open source software contribution? Want to learn more about 
the contributing process in GitHub? Need a refresher because it's 
been awhile?

Join us as we walk through some of the basics of git and navigating 
Github and how to use these tools to participate in Hacktoberfest 
2020! Bring your questions!

But wait! This event changed since the last time I was on this 
page - why is that?
We wanted to cover the basics of git this month so that you can 
get started on October 1st and earn your free t-shirt even earlier 
(or you can also wait until our October event to get started)! 
There are a lot of beginner projects available during Hacktoberfest 
to start with and get comfortable with git and opensource!

Do I have to actually commit this to memory to be successful?
Absolutely not! There are many, many guides and cheatsheets for git 
commands and we've all looked them up. It might eventually become 
muscle memory tho!

Will you still be doing technical talks on some projects I can 
contribute to?
Yes! We're busy planning our October event which will (should) 
feature tech projects you can contribute to and technical overviews 
of those projects. In the meantime, feel free to post about your 
issues in our slack or facebook if you get stuck or need suggestions 
for issues.

Will this be recorded?
Yes! This way, you can reference it when you're working on issues on 
your own time. (But don't worry, we will recorded it in speaker 
view so that only Sandi and her presentation are in view.)
