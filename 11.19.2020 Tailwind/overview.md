### Overview
Are you interested in branching out from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/)? Try Tailwind! It's a rapidly growing, utility-first CSS framework. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) doesn't have a default theme, and there are no built-in UI components. Instead, Tailwind provides you with a set of easy to remember [CSS](https://dev.to/ladybug/css-cheat-sheets-3ee0) helper classes, allowing you to create custom, responsive designs with ease.

All of our events are inclusive and welcoming. We encourage ALL folks to attend and participate in our community, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, socioeconomic status, caste, creed, political affiliation, or preferred programming language(s). We aim to provide a safe space for learning and an empowering experience for under represented voices in tech to be heard.
