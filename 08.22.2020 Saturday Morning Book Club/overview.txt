FAQ

Q: I didn’t have time to read the articles. Can I still join even the event?

join in the discussion in response to other folk’s questions and answers with
your own experiences and opinions

Q: Do I have to participate?
A: While we encourage participation and want to hear your opinions, we know 
that not everyone is comfortable sharing, especially in the digital setting.

a way to make it more comfortable for you to participate, please let us know.

Q: Will this actually last two hours?
A: It will last as long folks want to talk (up to two hours). We are carving 
two hours out of our Saturday to make sure everyone has time to say their piece 
but we won't drag on the conversation if it naturally comes to an end earlier. 
Also, feel free to come and go as you need.

Q: Will this be recorded?
A: Nope, just us this time. We aim to create a safe environment for you to 
share your thoughts. We might take a picture though. :)

events like this in the future and would love community input!
